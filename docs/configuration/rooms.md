## Creating Rooms
Click "Add Room" to create a new room.
Double click on any room to edit the details.

Each room in CP is attached to a sensor within Home Assistant. 

Each room can have multiple sensors.

### Room Sensor Configuration
Room sensors can be of two types:

- Occupancy sensors (e.g. PIR sensors, radar sensors etc) can determine if a person is in a room.
- Presence sensors (e.g. Device trackers) can tell which person is in a room
