## Creating Edges
An edge refers to a "portal" from one room to another (or to the outside). You can create an edge by dragging from the bottom or top center of the room and connecting it to the other room.

### Doorway Sensor Configuration
Edges can have sensors that detect people moving between rooms. The sensors we use can detect the direction of travel (checkout [this](https://github.com/NilSkilz/contextual-presence/actions) project for details).
